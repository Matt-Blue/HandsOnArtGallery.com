                    Lorna Bluestein was born and raised in Indiana. 
                    She received her BA in Fine Arts at Indiana University. 
                    She spent five years in Massachusetts working as a retail manager.  
                    She then married and moved to Colorado where she spent twenty years 
                    living the beautiful mountain life. 
                    During this time she raised two kids and taught preschool children. 
                    In 2014, Lorna and her family relocated to Florida to be near their relatives. 
                    Lorna found a job teaching high school art. 
                    One of her students asked her to keep the art program HANDS ON, 
                    instead of converting all the art to technology. 
                    This suggestion inspired her to experiment and include a variety of 
                    mediums and techniques into her lessons. 
                    Lornaâ€™s passion for art was back stronger than ever and this gave her 
                    the ambition to start her own business. Her goal is to teach a variety of art styles 
                    and techniques to all ages and to inspire those who wish to learn 
                    HANDS ON craftsmanship.

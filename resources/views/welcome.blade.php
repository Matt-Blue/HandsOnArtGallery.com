                    Lorna Bluestein was born and raised in Indiana. She received her BA in Fine Arts at Indiana University. She spent five years in Massachusetts working as a retail manager.  She then married and moved to Colorado where she spent twenty years living the beautiful mountain life. During this time she raised two kids while teaching preschool. In 2014, her family moved to Florida to be near to family. Lorna found a job teaching high school art. One of her students asked her to keep the art program hands on, instead of converting all the art to technology. This suggestion inspired her to experiment and include a variety of mediums and techniques into her lessons. Lornaâ€™s passion for art was back stronger than ever and this gave her the ambition to start her own business. Her goal is to teach a variety of art styles and techniques to all ages and to inspire those who wish to learn <i>hands on</i> craftsmanship.
